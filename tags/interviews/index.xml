            </div><p>In some weeks I&rsquo;ll be starting a new adventure in another company. In this post I&rsquo;m sharing some tips and ideas about hiring processes after sending countless resumes, facing innumerable interviews, technical challenges, and finally being hired by a promising team.</p>
<h2 id="my-previous-experience">My previous experience</h2>
<p>Before I decided to leave my current employer I participated in no more than three hiring processes, so we can say that I had almost no experience at all in terms of how to behave and how to succeed. When I decided to start this journey I found that everyone was recommending the <em><a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Cracking the Code Interview</a></em> book, so I decided to give it a try with a non-exhaustive diagonal read. If you have time I recommend you to do the same (or even better, to read it entirely). It contains a lot of worthy information even if you aren&rsquo;t looking for a job: it gives you behavioral recommendations, refreshes your knowledge about algorithms and data structures, and unveils the most common questions you will face during interviews.</p>]]></description>

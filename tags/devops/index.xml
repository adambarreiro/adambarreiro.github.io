            </div><p>In <a href="/2020-06-03-how-to-execute-jenkins-jobs-programatically/" rel="">this post</a> we saw how to trigger a Jenkins job in a programatic way, with a very simple source code snippet in Groovy to illustrate how to do it. In this post we&rsquo;ll revisit the same topic, but with a Bash script. As you&rsquo;ll see, the script is more <em>sophisticated</em> as it not only runs the job, but also waits the job to complete and retrieve an hypothetical file hosted as an artifact.</p>]]></description>

            </div><p>Some days ago I decided to take the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam, after postponing it for almost a year. My voucher was about to expire, and one of the reasons that I took so long was that the more I read about it the more scared I was to schedule it. Was this fear reasonable? Well, I scored 90% and I can assure you I&rsquo;m not a Kubernetes expert. With this post, I hope I help you to clear your doubts to pass the exam.</p>]]></description>

            </div><p>The most common usage of Jenkins is to trigger job builds automatically in response to changes in a source code repository. In some other cases you may need to trigger jobs because of any other reason. For example, imagine that you want to execute a Jenkins job after your alert management system detects something is wrong, so it can execute a pipeline that fixes everything and the alert is resolved. This is just an example, but the idea of this post is to be able to <strong>execute a Jenkins job programatically</strong>, and not using the GUI or anything related to Jenkins itself.</p>]]></description>

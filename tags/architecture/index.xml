            </div><p>Some things happened recently that made me write this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First one, <a href="https://hey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">HEY</a> was released. If you are not from this planet and never heard about HEY, you only need to know that it is a new and peculiar email service that made a bit of noise in social networks due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">some issues with Apple</a>. Anyway, the point is that <strong>David Heinemeier Hansson</strong> made some statements about its architecture on Twitter&hellip; he declared <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1275904559001464832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">it was a monolithic application</a>. I think everyone was expecting it to be something really complex, but it turns out that <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-can-become-the-citadel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">all apps from Basecamp are monoliths</a>.</p>]]></description>

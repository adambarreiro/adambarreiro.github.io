      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some things happened recently that made me write this post:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First one, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hey.com/&#34;&gt;HEY&lt;/a&gt; was released. If you are not from this planet and never heard about HEY, you only need to know that it is a new and peculiar email service that made a bit of noise in social networks due to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust&#34;&gt;some issues with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, the point is that &lt;strong&gt;David Heinemeier Hansson&lt;/strong&gt; made some statements about its architecture on Twitter&amp;hellip; he declared &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1275904559001464832&#34;&gt;it was a monolithic application&lt;/a&gt;. I think everyone was expecting it to be something really complex, but it turns out that &lt;a href=&#34;https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-can-become-the-citadel/&#34;&gt;all apps from Basecamp are monoliths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

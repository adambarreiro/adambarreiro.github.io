            </div><p>In some weeks I&rsquo;ll be starting a new adventure in another company. In this post I&rsquo;m sharing some tips and ideas about hiring processes after sending countless resumes, facing innumerable interviews, technical challenges, and finally being hired by a promising team.</p>
<h2 id="my-previous-experience">My previous experience</h2>
<p>Before I decided to leave my current employer I participated in no more than three hiring processes, so we can say that I had almost no experience at all in terms of how to behave and how to succeed. When I decided to start this journey I found that everyone was recommending the <em><a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Cracking the Code Interview</a></em> book, so I decided to give it a try with a non-exhaustive diagonal read. If you have time I recommend you to do the same (or even better, to read it entirely). It contains a lot of worthy information even if you aren&rsquo;t looking for a job: it gives you behavioral recommendations, refreshes your knowledge about algorithms and data structures, and unveils the most common questions you will face during interviews.</p>]]></description>

            </div><p>Some things happened recently that made me write this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First one, <a href="https://hey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">HEY</a> was released. If you are not from this planet and never heard about HEY, you only need to know that it is a new and peculiar email service that made a bit of noise in social networks due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">some issues with Apple</a>. Anyway, the point is that <strong>David Heinemeier Hansson</strong> made some statements about its architecture on Twitter&hellip; he declared <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1275904559001464832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">it was a monolithic application</a>. I think everyone was expecting it to be something really complex, but it turns out that <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-can-become-the-citadel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">all apps from Basecamp are monoliths</a>.</p>]]></description>

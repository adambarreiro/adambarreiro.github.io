      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some days ago I decided to take the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam, after postponing it for almost a year. My voucher was about to expire, and one of the reasons that I took so long was that the more I read about it the more scared I was to schedule it. Was this fear reasonable? Well, I scored 90% and I can assure you I&amp;rsquo;m not a Kubernetes expert. With this post, I hope I help you to clear your doubts to pass the exam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
